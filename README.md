# Robotics Project

This project contains two main exercises developed using ROS 1 Noetic:

1. **Differential Drive Wheeled Robot (Jackal)**  
   Programming and trajectory planning of the Jackal robot in both simulation (using Gazebo and RViz) and real-world conditions.

2. **Robotic Arm (rrbot)**  
   Motion programming of a 2-DOF robotic arm in simulation to follow predefined trajectories using ROS 1 Noetic, Gazebo, and RViz.

Robot movement data is recorded in ROS bag files. These bag files are then used to generate graphical visualizations of the robotâ€™s trajectories and movements using the bagpy_analysis.py files.

## Technologies Used
- ROS 1 Noetic  
- Gazebo Simulator  
- RViz Visualization  
- Python  
- ROS bag for data recording and analysis  

## Collaborators
This project was developed by Ilias Varthalitis and Aristeidis Panagiotou.
